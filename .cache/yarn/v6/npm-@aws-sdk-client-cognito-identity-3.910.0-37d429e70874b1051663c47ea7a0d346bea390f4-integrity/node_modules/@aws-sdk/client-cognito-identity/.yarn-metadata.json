It uniquely identifies a\ndevice and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an\napplication.</p>\n<p>Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or\nmore third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon\nCognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.\nCognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider\ntrusted by Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege Amazon Web Services credentials.</p>\n<p>For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide\nsee <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authentication-flow.html\">Authentication\nFlow</a>.</p>\n<p>For more information see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html\">Amazon Cognito Federated\nIdentities</a>.</p>\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity\nusing your favorite package manager:\n\n- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity`\n- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity`\n- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity`\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Import\n\nThe AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.\nTo send a request, you only need to import the `CognitoIdentityClient` and\nthe commands you need, for example `ListIdentityPoolsCommand`:\n\n```js\n// ES5 example\nconst { CognitoIdentityClient, ListIdentityPoolsCommand } = require(\"@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity\");\n```\n\n```ts\n// ES6+ example\nimport { CognitoIdentityClient, ListIdentityPoolsCommand } from \"@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity\";\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo send a request, you:\n\n- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).\n- Initiate command with input parameters.\n- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.\n- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.\n\n```js\n// a client can be shared by different commands.\nconst client = new CognitoIdentityClient({ region: \"REGION\" });\n\nconst params = {\n  /** input parameters */\n};\nconst command = new ListIdentityPoolsCommand(params);\n```\n\n#### Async/await\n\nWe recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)\noperator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:\n\n```js\n// async/await.\ntry {\n  const data = await client.send(command);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  // error handling.\n} finally {\n  // finally.\n}\n```\n\nAsync-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling\nas compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.\n\n#### Promises\n\nYou can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)\nto execute send operation.\n\n```js\nclient.send(command).then(\n  (data) => {\n    // process data.\n  },\n  (error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  }\n);\n```\n\nPromises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:\n\n```js\nclient\n  .send(command)\n  .then((data) => {\n    // process data.\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  })\n  .finally(() => {\n    // finally.\n  });\n```\n\n#### Callbacks\n\nWe do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),\nbut they are supported by the send operation.\n\n```js\n// callbacks.\nclient.send(command, (err, data) => {\n  // process err and data.\n});\n```\n\n#### v2 compatible style\n\nThe client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.\nHowever, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post\non [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)\n\n```ts\nimport * as AWS from \"@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity\";\nconst client = new AWS.CognitoIdentity({ region: \"REGION\" });\n\n// async/await.\ntry {\n  const data = await client.listIdentityPools(params);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  // error handling.\n}\n\n// Promises.\nclient\n  .listIdentityPools(params)\n  .then((data) => {\n    // process data.\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  });\n\n// callbacks.\nclient.listIdentityPools(params, (err, data) => {\n  // process err and data.\n});\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nWhen the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,\nas well as response metadata (e.g. request id).\n\n```js\ntry {\n  const data = await client.send(command);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$metadata;\n  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });\n  /**\n   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.\n   * You can access them by specifying exception names:\n   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {\n   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;\n   * }\n   */\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nPlease use these community resources for getting help.\nWe use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests, but have limited bandwidth to address them.\n\n- Visit [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html)\n  or [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/index.html).\n- Check out the blog posts tagged with [`aws-sdk-js`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/tag/aws-sdk-js/)\n  on AWS Developer Blog.\n- Ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-sdk-js) and tag it with `aws-sdk-js`.\n- Join the AWS JavaScript community on [gitter](https://gitter.im/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).\n- If it turns out that you may have found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/new/choose).\n\nTo test your universal JavaScript code in Node.js, browser and react-native environments,\nvisit our [code samples repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-sdk-js-tests).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis client code is generated automatically. Any modifications will be overwritten the next time the `@aws-sdk/client-cognito-identity` package is updated.\nTo contribute to client you can check our [generate clients

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
