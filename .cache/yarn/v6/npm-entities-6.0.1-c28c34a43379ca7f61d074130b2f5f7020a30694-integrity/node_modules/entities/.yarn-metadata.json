You are fine with\n  UTF8? That'll save you some bytes. Prefer to only have ASCII characters? We\n  can do that as well!\n\n## How to…\n\n### …install `entities`\n\n    npm install entities\n\n### …use `entities`\n\n```javascript\nconst entities = require(\"entities\");\n\n// Encoding\nentities.escapeUTF8(\"&#38; ü\"); // \"&amp;#38; ü\"\nentities.encodeXML(\"&#38; ü\"); // \"&amp;#38; &#xfc;\"\nentities.encodeHTML(\"&#38; ü\"); // \"&amp;&num;38&semi; &uuml;\"\n\n// Decoding\nentities.decodeXML(\"asdf &amp; &#xFF; &#xFC; &apos;\"); // \"asdf & ÿ ü '\"\nentities.decodeHTML(\"asdf &amp; &yuml; &uuml; &apos;\"); // \"asdf & ÿ ü '\"\n```\n\n## Performance\n\nThis is how `entities` compares to other libraries on a very basic benchmark\n(see `scripts/benchmark.ts`, for 10,000,000 iterations; **lower is better**):\n\n| Library        | Version | `decode` perf | `encode` perf | `escape` perf |\n| -------------- | ------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| entities       | `3.0.1` | 1.418s        | 6.786s        | 2.196s        |\n| html-entities  | `2.3.2` | 2.530s        | 6.829s        | 2.415s        |\n| he             | `1.2.0` | 5.800s        | 24.237s       | 3.624s        |\n| parse-entities | `3.0.0` | 9.660s        | N/A           | N/A           |\n\n---\n\n## FAQ\n\n> What methods should I actually use to encode my documents?\n\nIf your target supports UTF-8, the `escapeUTF8` method is going to be your best\nchoice. Otherwise, use either `encodeHTML` or `encodeXML` based on whether\nyou're dealing with an HTML or an XML document.\n\nYou can have a look at the options for the `encode` and `decode` methods to see\neverything you can configure.\n\n> When should I use strict decoding?\n\nWhen strict decoding, entities not terminated with a semicolon will be ignored.\nThis is helpful for decoding entities in legacy environments.\n\n> Why should I use `entities` instead of alternative modules?\n\nAs of April 2022, `entities` is a bit faster than other modules. Still, this is\nnot a very differentiated space and other modules can catch up.\n\n**More importantly**, you might already have `entities` in your dependency graph\n(as a dependency of eg. `cheerio`, or `htmlparser2`), and including it directly\nmight not even increase your bundle size. The same is true for other entity\nlibraries, so have a look through your `node_modules` directory!\n\n> Does `entities` support tree shaking?\n\nYes! `entities` ships as both a CommonJS and a ES module. Note that for best\nresults, you should not use the `encode` and `decode` functions, as they wrap\naround a number of other functions, all of which will remain in the bundle.\nInstead, use the functions that you need directly.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis library wouldn't be possible without the work of these individuals. Thanks\nto\n\n- [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) for his explanations about\n  character encodings, and his library `he`, which was one of the inspirations\n  for `entities`\n- [@inikulin](https://github.com/inikulin) for his work on optimized tries for\n  decoding HTML entities for the `parse5` project\n- [@mdevils](https://github.com/mdevils) for taking on the challenge of\n  producing a quick entity library with his `html-entities` library. `entities`\n  would be quite a bit slower if there wasn't any competition. Right now\n  `entities` is on top, but we'll see how long that lasts!\n\n---\n\nLicense: BSD-2-Clause\n\n## Security contact information\n\nTo report a security vulnerability, please use the\n[Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security).
